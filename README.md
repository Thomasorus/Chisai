# Ch朝sai!

> A small website generator, editable and hosted on github, with automatic deployment!

## Purpose and mission

Ch朝sai is aimed at empowering people who need a free solution to have their own small space on the internet without falling into the CMS install and maintenance crazyness. All content is in markdown files, in folders, and the user can edit, upload images and host on github.

Ch朝sai answers three very important things for me when it comes to websites:

1. It should be easy to modify by someone else
2. It should be durable and long lasting
3. Each person should own the code of its website

## Who can use it?

Ch朝sai is a free to use by individuals and organizations that do not operate by capitalist principles. For more information see the [license](LICENSE) file.

## How does it work?

You can see a demo [here](https://thomasorus.github.io/Chisai/). It's quite simple:

- Each section is a folder with files named as the dates of their publication.
- Each section has it's parent section that regroups all the files inside.
- All sections 5 latest entries are regrouped on the home page with a link to see the full content.
- Content is edited using the Markdown syntax (the same you can find on Discord or Slack).
- Edit the content (create folders, files, edit files) directly on github, here!

That's all!

## How to use it?

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Thomasorus/Chisai/wiki) for extensive guides for everything!

## Can I self-host it?

Yes of course! Chisai only produces HTML. You can add the generated website on your own server. Even better: if your server has Python, you can rebuild the website direcly on your server. Be careful that you might have to reconfigure some things to make it work.
